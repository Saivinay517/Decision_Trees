# project Title:
Prediction of "Iris.csv" dataset for decision tree algorithm using Supervised Learning Machine algorithm
# Problem Statement:
A american based botnical garden a grow iris flower in their labs but using Bio-Technology in a single tree different type of varity flower is grow as a data science engineer find out how much accuracy is their all categories contain same species.

# Conclusion:
According to my decision tree model the flower not contain excat same species,but only 1 percent is accuracy for getting all species.
